# üêù Bee Alive

A live demo is available [here](https://naomihauret.github.io/beeAlive).
This project was realised as an assessment for our creative coding class. 
It's a teamwork with [@MaitreManuel](https://github.com/MaitreManuel) :muscle:

## What the heck ?
Did you know that bees appeared approximately 100 millions years ago, roughly at the same period than flowering plants ? That they survived the mass extinction that wrecked *Tyrannosaurus Rex* of the surface of Earth ?

And did you know that :

- 84‚ÄØ% of known flowering plants need bees to survive
- 85‚ÄØ% of cultivated plants in Europe depends on bees for their pollination
- ‚ÄØOut of the hundres vegetal species that give us 90% of our food in the world, more than 70‚ÄØ% relies on bees to survive via pollination
- Without bees, Humanity won't last more than 2 years

Sadly, each year, approximately more than 20% of domestic honeybees hives disappear. Mostly because of Humanity's actions.

This project was born from this constat : no bees, no life. Here, we're exploring how the environment around us might look like with a certain amount of bees.
